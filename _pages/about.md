I am a PhD student in Operations Research at Stanford MS&E, where Iâ€™m very fortunate to be advised by [Ramesh Johari](https://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/), and to work closely with [Yue Hu](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/yue-hu/) and [Tianyi Peng](https://tianyipeng.github.io/). I received an M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia IEOR and a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Previously, I was a student researcher at CMU Heinz and Microsoft Research.

My research interests lie in stochastic modeling and decision-making under uncertainty, with a focus on applications in experimental design, causal inference, and queueing control. On the applied side, I am interested in developing practical algorithms for simulation and optimization.

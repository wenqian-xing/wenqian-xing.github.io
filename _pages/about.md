<!--I am fortunate to work with [Ramesh Johari](https://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/) and [Yue Hu](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/yue-hu/).--> 
I am a second-year PhD student in Operations Research at Stanford MS&E. I received an M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia IEOR and a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Previously, I was a student researcher at CMU Heinz and Microsoft Research.

My research interests lie in stochastic modeling and decision-making under uncertainty, with a focus on applications in queueing systems, experimental design, and causal inference. From a practical view, I am also interested in developing applied simulation and optimization algorithms.

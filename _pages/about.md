I am a Ph.D. student in [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, where I’m fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ramesh Johari](https://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/), and to work closely with Prof. [Yue Hu](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/yue-hu/) and Prof. [Tianyi Peng](https://tianyipeng.github.io/).  
I hold an M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia University and a B.S.E. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan — Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute. I also spent time as a research intern at CMU Heinz and Microsoft Research Asia.  

My research interests lie broadly in *stochastic modeling* and *decision-making under uncertainty*, with a focus on experimental design, causal inference, and AI agent. On the applied side, I am interested in developing practical algorithms for simulation and optimization.

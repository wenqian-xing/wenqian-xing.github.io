I am a second-year PhD student in Operations Research at Stanford MS&E. I received an M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia IEOR and a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Previously, I was a student researcher at CMU Heinz and Microsoft Research.

My research interests lie in stochastic modeling and decision-making under uncertainty, with a focus on applications in queueing control, experimental design, and causal inference. On the applied side, I am interested in developing practical algorithms for simulation and optimization.

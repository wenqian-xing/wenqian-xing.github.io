I am a PhD student in [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, where Iâ€™m fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ramesh Johari](https://web.stanford.edu/~rjohari/), and to work closely with Prof. [Yue Hu](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/yue-hu/) and Prof. [Tianyi Peng](https://tianyipeng.github.io/).  
I hold an M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia University and a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Previously, I was a student researcher at Carnegie Mellon University and Microsoft Research.

My research interests lie broadly in stochastic modeling and decision-making under uncertainty, with a focus on experimental design, causal inference, and queueing control. On the applied side, I am interested in developing practical algorithms for simulation and optimization.

I am a PhD student in Operations Research at Stanford MS&E. Prior to that, I was a visiting researcher at CMU Heinz. I received my M.S. degree in Operations Research from Columbia IEOR and my B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute. Previously, I did internship at Microsoft Research.

My research interests lie in stochastic modeling and decision-making under uncertainty, with a particular focus on applications in queueing systems, experimental design, and causal inference.

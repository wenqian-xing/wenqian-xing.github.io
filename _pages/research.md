Ongoing Works
------

**Switchback Experiments under Stochastically Monotone Markov Chains**  
with Jose H. Blanchet, Ramesh Johari, Peter Glynn, Linjia Wu  
Analyze switchback experiment design under temporal (Markovian) interference modeled by stochastically monotone Markov chains.  

**Experimental Design under Non-stationary Environments**  
with Ramesh Johari, Tianyi Peng  
Study experimental design and treatment effect estimation in non-stationary environments modeled as partially observed Markov chains.

**Online Learning for Reward-Driven and Congestion-Aware Service
Rate Control**  
with Yue Hu, Anand Kalvit, Vahid Sarhangian  
Manage the trade-off between unknown stochastic rewards and congestion using an online learning approach.
